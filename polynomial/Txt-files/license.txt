     are restricted to use in connection with on-campus computing

to support the use of the Programs in accordance with this 
Agreement. Licensee may not remove any copyright, trademark, 
proprietary rights, disclaimer or warning notice included on 
or embedded in any part of the Programs.  All copies of Programs 
shall contain all copyright and proprietary notices as in 
the original.  

PolyX supplies its Programs and Documentation in archival form 
on CD-ROM and by means of electronic distribution.  PolyX provides 
the Licensee with a personal license number that specifies the 
Programs licensed by Licensee.  Licensee shall not attempt to 
access or use Programs that Licensee is not currently licensed 
to use. Furthermore, Licensee shall not disclose the personal 
license number or allow it to be used except for installation 
of the Programs as provided herein. 

Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse 
engineer the Programs.  For European Union Licensees, 
the following rights apply: 

  EUROPEAN UNION: Licensee may only decompile, disassemble, 
  or otherwise reverse engineer the Programs where any such act 
  is necessary to create an independent program that is interoperable 
  with the Programs or with another program or to observe, study, or 
  test the functioning of the Programs solely in order to understand the 
  ideas and principles that underlie any element of the Programs  
  ('the Permitted Objective') and provided that:

  (a) this may only be done if the information necessary to achieve 
  the Permitted Objective has not already been made available or has 
  not been provided by PolyX within a reasonable time of a written 
  request to PolyX to provide such information;

  (b) the compilation, disassembly, or reverse-engineering is 
  confined to those parts of the Programs necessary to achieve 
  the Permitted Objective;

  (c) the information gained is not used for anything other than 
  the Permitted Objective and is not disclosed to any other person
  except as may be necessary to achieve the Permitted Objective; and

  (d) the information obtained is not used to create a program 
  substantially similar in its expression to the Programs including,
  but not limited to, expressions of the Programs in other computer
  languages, or for any other act restricted by copyright in the Programs.

Except as expressly provided by this Agreement, Licensee may not 
alter or modify the Programs without the consent of PolyX.  
In particular, Licensee may not alter, adapt, translate, or convert 
'M-files' or 'P-code' contained in the Programs in order to use those 
files with any products other than products of PolyX, nor may the 
Licensee incorporate or use 'M-files', 'P-code' or any other part 
of the Programs in or as part of another computer program.

All copies of the Programs and Documentation, whether made by 
Licensee or otherwise, shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

Licensee shall take appropriate action by instruction, agreement, or 
otherwise with any persons permitted access to the Programs, so as 
to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations under the terms of this 
Agreement.

FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions 
of the Program and Documentation by or for the federal government 
of the United States of America.  By accepting delivery of the Program, 
the government thereby agrees that this software qualifies as 'commercial' 
computer software within the meaning of FAR Part 12.212, 
DFARS Part 227.7202-1, DFARS Part 227.7202-3, DFARS Part 252.227-7013, 
and DFARS Part 252.227-7014.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement 
shall pertain to the government's use and disclosure of the Program and 
Documentation, and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms or 
conditions.  If this license fails to meet the government's minimum needs
or is inconsistent in any respect with federal procurement law, the 
government agrees to return the Program and Documentation, unused, to PolyX.

MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT. During any paid Maintenance and Support 
subscription term, if applicable, PolyX shall: deliver subsequent 
releases of the Programs that are not charged for separately; 
exert reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a reasonable 
time, workarounds for any material programming errors in the 
current release of the Programs that are directly attributable 
to PolyX, and (b) correct such errors in the next available release, 
provided Licensee provides PolyX with sufficient information to 
identify the problems.  During this same paid Maintenance and 
Support subscription term, Licensee shall also be entitled to receive 
technical support by telephone, fax or electronic mail regarding 
the installation and/or use of the Licensed Programs and their 
interaction with hardware, operating environments, and other 
software products. PolyX reserves the option to discontinue, 
in whole or in part, offering Maintenance and Support subscriptions 
for any Program or platform.  

TERM.    This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of (a) 
termination by PolyX or Licensee as provided below, or (b) such 
time as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee hereunder.  

  For Annual Licenses: LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT EACH 
  ANNUAL LICENSE WILL TERMINATE AFTER EACH ONE (1) YEAR PERIOD, 
  UNLESS LICENSEE RENEWS ITS LICENSE BY REMITTING THE THEN-CURRENT 
  ANNUAL LICENSE RENEWAL FEE.  PolyX or its authorized distributor 
  will notify Licensee in advance of each renewal term.  LICENSEE 
  UNDERSTANDS THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL STOP OPERATING UNLESS LICENSEE 
  PAYS THE LICENSE RENEWAL FEE AND IS GIVEN RENEWAL PASSCODES.  
  Maintenance and Support subscriptions are included in the original 
  license fee and any subsequent renewal.

  For Perpetual Licenses: Licensee shall have the right to use the 
  Programs indefinitely, subject to the TERMINATION provisions in
  this Agreement.  LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT THE 
  MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF EACH PERPETUAL LICENSE WILL TERMINATE
  UPON EXPIRATION OF THE INITIAL ONE (1) YEAR SUBSCRIPTION TERM 
  INCLUDED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE LICENSE.  Thereafter, the 
  Maintenance and Support subscription term may be renewed for any 
  Program, in one year increments, at the then-current price, so long
  as PolyX offers such Maintenance and Support.  PolyX or its 
  authorized distributor will notify Licensee in advance of each 
  Maintenance and Support subscription renewal term.

  For Student Licenses: The Student License term extends only for 
  the duration of Licensee's enrollment in a degree-granting 
  institution or participation in a continuing education program 
  of a degree-granting institution.

TERMINATION.  PolyX may terminate this license grant, by written 
notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any material term of this 
license, including failure to pay any license fees due, and Licensee 
has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of written 
notification.  Licensee may terminate this license at any time, for 
any reason.  Licensee shall not be entitled to any refund if this 
license is terminated, except for license fees paid for any 
Programs for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the 
time of termination.  Upon termination, Licensee shall promptly 
return all but archival copies of the Programs and Documentation in 
Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written 
certification of their destruction.

EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to export control 
laws of the Czech Republic. Notwithstanding any other term of 
this Agreement or third party agreement, Licensee's rights under 
this Agreement may not be exercised by Licensee or any Third 
Party in violation of such laws and regulations, nor may this 
Agreement be transferred to any party where doing so would 
result in such a violation.  The terms of any limitation on the 
use, transfer or re-export of the Programs and Documentation 
imposed by PolyX in any Destination Control Statement or other 
document for the purpose of export control shall prevail over 
any term in this Agreement.

TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificate(s), 
Licensee shall pay all taxes, duties, or customs, except for taxes 
based on PolyX net income.

USE OF NAME AND TRADEMARKS.  Licensee shall not use the name, trade 
names or trademarks of PolyX or any of its Affiliates in any 
advertising, promotional literature or any other material, whether 
in written, electronic, or other form, distributed to any Third Party, 
except in the form provided by PolyX, and then solely for purposes 
of identifying PolyX Programs. 

ASSIGNMENT. This license is nontransferable to a Third Party without 
PolyX consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  This 
license may be transferred to an Affiliate provided that PolyX 
is notified in writing of the transfer and the Affiliate accepts 
these same terms and conditions.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  THE PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS 
THE SOLE BASIS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WHOSE INCORRECT SOLUTION COULD 
RESULT IN INJURY TO PERSON OR PROPERTY.  IF A PROGRAM IS EMPLOYED 
IN SUCH A MANNER, IT IS AT THE LICENSEE'S OWN RISK AND POLYX 
EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR SUCH MISUSE TO THE EXTENT 
ALLOWED BY LAW. POLYX'S LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE OR FOR ANY OTHER MATTER IN RELATION TO 
WHICH LIABILITY BY LAW CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED SHALL NOT 
BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED. EXCEPT AS AFORESAID, (A) ANY OTHER 
LIABILITY OF POLYX (WHETHER IN RELATION TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT IN TOTAL EXCEED THE AMOUNT 
PAID TO POLYX UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD 
PRECEDING THE CLAIM IN QUESTION, FOR THE PROGRAM WITH RESPECT 
TO WHICH THE LIABILITY IN QUESTION ARISES, AS INSTALLED ON THE 
DESIGNATED COMPUTER(S) OR DESIGNATED SERVER(S) FOR WHICH USE OF 
THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED HEREUNDER; AND (B) POLYX SHALL HAVE NO 
LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS (WHETHER 
FORESEEABLE OR OTHERWISE AND INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF 
BUSINESS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, AND LOSS OF USE OF ANY COMPUTER 
HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE).  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE 
ABOVE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.  

LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  PolyX warrants that PolyX 
or its licensors has the right to grant the license rights hereunder.  
PolyX warrants that the physical media provided shall be free from 
defects in material and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days 
from delivery, or it will be replaced by PolyX at no cost to Licensee.  
PolyX further warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery, 
that each copy of each Program will conform in all material respects 
to the description of such Program's operation in the Documentation.  
In the event that the Program does not operate as warranted, 
Licensee's exclusive remedy and PolyX sole liability under this 
warranty shall be a) the correction or workaround by PolyX of major 
defects within a reasonable time, or b) should such correction or 
workaround prove neither satisfactory nor practical, termination of 
the relevant license and refund of the initial license fee paid to 
PolyX for the Programs.  All requests for warranty assistance should 
be directed to  PolyX, Ltd., Jarní 4, 16000, Prague 6, Czech Republic.  
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BY THIS AGREEMENT (OR AS IMPLIED BY LAW 
WHERE THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THE PARTICULAR TERMS IMPLIED CANNOT BE 
EXCLUDED BY CONTRACT), ALL OTHER CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER 
TERMS (INCLUDING ANY WITH REGARD TO INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, 
OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE) ARE EXCLUDED.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW 
LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.  THIS WARRANTY GIVES LICENSEE 
SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS 
WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.  LICENSEE ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ITS USE OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED THEREFROM.

GENERAL. To the extent any law, treaty, or regulation is in conflict 
with this Agreement, the conflicting terms of this Agreement shall 
be superseded only to the extent necessary by such law, treaty, or 
regulation.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be otherwise 
unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall 
be enforced to the maximum extent permissible.  In either case, 
the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.  The 
parties agree that the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.  
This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties 
and may not be modified or amended except by written instrument, 
executed by authorized representatives of PolyX and Licensee.
